This is the main marketing website for an artist. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers and other artists.

# Site Info

This website functions as a comprehensive portfolio for an artist, offering clear insights into the creator's background alongside a showcase of their artistic endeavors. The inclusion of a dedicated contact page facilitates direct communication with the artist, catering to potential commissioners and fellow artists who might be interested in collaboration. The website provides a customisable platform beyond the constraints of standard formats on platforms like Instagram or TikTok.

The design philosophy prioritises simplicity, opting for a minimalistic approach and subtle colour themes to ensure the users attention is solely on the artists work. The overarching goal is to offer visitors pertinent information about the artist, an immersive exploration of their portfolio and an open invitation for communication if they wish to connect.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

In crafting the colour scheme for this website, a thoughtful selection of colours was made to ensure a sleek and visually appealing presentation. The chosen palette, comprising of soft greys and whites, was curated to strike a harmonious balance. The use of light greys provides a clean and modern backdrop, allowing the vibrant artworks to take center stage without distraction.

### Typography

The typography of the website embodies a basic, modern and sleek aesthetic, enchancing the overall visual appeal. The site predominantly utilizes the clean and contemporary Roboto font for body text and various sections, maintaining readability across devices. The header features Roboto with a weight of 600, ensuring a distinct appearance, while navigation menu links, set in Roboto with a weight of 500, offer a balanced and easily navigable experience. Consistency in font choices, letter-spacing, and line-height is evident in bio sections, contributing to a well-organised presentation.

### Imagery

Visuals play a crucial role, particularly showcasing artworks in high quality to captivate the audience. Emphasis is on showcasing a diverse range of art pieces through the gallery section.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/) to sketch the wireframes and start having a general idea of how the website would have looked like. There have been deviations from the original ideas, such as:

- the use of a testimonials and reviews section;
- using an image of the artist on the contact page;
- the position of the social media icons.

Below, a showcase of the desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes.
