## Design

### Design Choices

The website has been designed choosing a minimal style, clear and user friendly. Borders - when present - are neat and light. Pages are not filled with unnecessary information. The overall design choice is subtle and light.

![Colour](docs/features/colours.jpg.png)

### Colour Scheme

In crafting the colour scheme for this website, a thoughtful selection of colours was made to ensure a sleek and visually appealing presentation. The chosen palette, comprising of soft greys and whites, was curated to strike a harmonious balance. The use of light greys provides a clean and modern backdrop, allowing the vibrant artworks to take center stage without distraction.

### Typography

The typography of the website embodies a basic, modern and sleek aesthetic, enchancing the overall visual appeal. The site predominantly utilizes the clean and contemporary Roboto font for body text and various sections, maintaining readability across devices. The header features Roboto with a weight of 600, ensuring a distinct appearance, while navigation menu links, set in Roboto with a weight of 500, offer a balanced and easily navigable experience. Consistency in font choices, letter-spacing, and line-height is evident in bio sections, contributing to a well-organised presentation.

### Imagery

Visuals play a crucial role, particularly showcasing artworks in high quality to captivate the audience. Emphasis is on showcasing a diverse range of art pieces through the gallery section.

### Structure

The website is easy to navigate, essential, hence user friendly. It consists of four separate pages:

#### Homepage

A landing page with two text containers and a few teaser images.

#### Gallery

A page with a list of images of the artists work.

#### Contact

A page with a contact form for people to get in touch with the artist.

#### Confirmation Page

A page with a confirmation message after submission of the contact form.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/) to sketch the wireframes and start having a general idea of how the website would have looked like. There have been deviations from the original ideas, such as:

- the use of a testimonials and reviews section;
- using an image of the artist on the contact page;
- the position of the social media icons.

Below, a showcase of the desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes.

- Testing using Lighthouse tool in Chrome Developer tools provided a decent score but also suggested to improve:
    - Properly sizing images and serving them in a next-gen format to decrease load time for users.
    - Optimise website performance by addressing render-blocking resources.
    - Enhance website loading performance by reducing unused CSS eliminate or defer styles not crucial for above-the-fold content, potentially saving significant bytes transferred over the network.
    - Some links do not have discernible names.
- The links were changed to include aria-labels, this increased the accessibility to a perfect score.
